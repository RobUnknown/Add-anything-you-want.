# Add anything you want.
This was originally be supposed to be a Discord bot, but I can't be bothered to set that up. If anybody wants to turn it into one anyway feel free.
To be able to add stuff you'll probably have to suggest changes or make a pull request or fork or something I don't know how Github works.

# Rules:

0. Follow Github ToS and all laws in your country.
1. Nothing you add should be non-family-friendly or inappropriate.
2. Nothing you add should be mean or rude to an individual or group of people.
3. Nothing you add should be stereotyping or harmful in any other way.
